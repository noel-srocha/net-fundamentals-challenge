## Project Challenge
For this challenge, I was to use my knowledge acquired while studying the Fundamentals module and build a Parking Lot system.

## Context
You were contracted to build a system for a parking lot, which will be used to manage parked vehicles and perform the lot's operations, e.g. add and remove vehicles (and display the charged value for the period) and list parked vehicles.

## How did I arrive at the solution?
Digital Innovation One (DIO) provided with the initial files to work on. After reading what was needed to be implemented to achieve the desired result, I was simply add a way to add and remove vehicles to the system, calculate the amount to pay after leaving the parking lot and listing all parked vehicles.

## How to run the project?

1) Clone this repository (Ideally from Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider)

2) Once properly downloaded, hit the Run button!
